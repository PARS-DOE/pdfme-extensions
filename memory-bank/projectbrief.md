# PDFme Extensions Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a package of additional schemas for the PDFme library, extending the functionality beyond the core text, image, and barcode schemas that are currently available. This will be a community contribution to enhance the PDFme ecosystem.

## Core Goals
1. Fork relevant portions of the @pdfme/schemas repository
2. Implement new schema types that extend PDFme's capabilities
3. Create a well-documented, maintainable open-source package
4. Provide an easy integration path for PDFme users

## Success Criteria
- Package can be easily installed via npm
- New schemas work seamlessly with PDFme's existing API
- Documentation clearly explains how to use the extensions
- Code follows best practices and is well-tested

## Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with PDFme's plugin architecture
- Must follow the plugin structure (pdf, ui, propPanel) as defined in PDFme documentation

## Timeline
TBD
