# PDFme Extensions Progress

## Project Status: Initialization Phase

### What Works
- Memory bank documentation has been set up to track project knowledge
- Project scope and goals have been defined
- Initial research on PDFme's plugin architecture has been completed
- Decision made to fork entire repository and maintain playground for testing

### What's Left to Build
- Fork and setup of complete repository
- Development environment configuration
- Enhanced schema implementations focusing on text capabilities
- Testing and integration with playground
- Documentation and examples

### Current Status
The project is in the very early stages of development. We have established the conceptual framework and have decided on a full repository fork approach to maintain the playground for testing.

### Known Issues
- Need to understand the limitations of the current PDF rendering approach
- Need to determine how to implement conditional formatting within current constraints
- Need to explore approaches for implementing true table structures
- Need to establish strategy for maintaining compatibility with future PDFme updates

## Prioritized Schema Enhancements

| Schema Type | Priority | Status | Description |
|-------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Enhanced Text | High | Planned | Text with conditional formatting, improved numerical formatting, and border options |
| Label | High | Planned | Dedicated readonly text element with enhanced formatting |
| Table Display | High | Planned | True table structures with aligned cells and borders |
| Conditional Elements | Medium | Planned | Elements with conditional visibility based on data |
| Signature | Medium | Planned | Digital signature capture |
| Rating | Low | Planned | Star/numerical rating display and input |
| Checkbox/Radio | Low | Planned | Enhanced form elements |

## Main Limitations to Address

### Visual Formatting Limitations
- **Conditional Background Coloring**: Add support for dynamic background colors based on field values
- **Numerical Value Formatting**: Implement proper currency formatting ($ symbols, thousands separators) and percentage formatting

### Layout Limitations
- **True Table Structures**: Create support for proper table layouts with aligned cells and borders
- **Responsive Content**: Add ability to adjust layout based on content length

### Functional Limitations
- **Conditional Element Visibility**: Implement ability to hide/show elements based on data conditions
- **Interactive Elements**: Explore support for basic interactive features

## Next Milestone: Repository Setup and Initial Analysis

- [ ] Fork complete PDFme repository
- [ ] Set up development environment following original workflow
- [ ] Run existing tests to ensure everything works
- [ ] Analyze existing schemas to identify extension points
- [ ] Create detailed plan for implementing enhanced text schema
